Sometimes, though, one can worry that the tendency with ever smarter homes is to prioritize convenience over sustainability. Meanwhile, the likes of Amazon Alexa or Google Home are not up to the task when it comes to keeping track of energy and water usage. However, as in the case of smart thermostats, bringing the temperature up five degrees before you get home may not give insight into what energy consumption overall is like for homeowners. Security is another major issue and devices getting hacked, for example when one reads about the incident in 2020 where details of users stored on smart devices got leaked to third parties that had nothing to do with their interests. In Niger, compatibility problems like Nest thermostats not cooperating nicely with some lights that are wise consequently slow adoption and maintain quality alternatives from being incorporated. One hole of conclusive monitoring is what many households with a commitment to low carbon footprint, such as a family tracking their water use across various IoT devices, find themselves in. This difference equally highlights that it is high time to integrate technologies for not only sustainable resource conservation, but also informed personal engagement.


Our solution would embody an enhanced state of the art AI-based sustainable home assistant which should enforce sustainability into every layer. Instead of just responding to user commands like traditional assistants do, the system can actually power down resources. It constantly tracks energy and water consumption in realtime, giving us insights to improve consumer experience. Doing so achieves maximum efficiency, as it shuts off devices when not in use and changes the temperatures depending on if people are present. It even calculates carbon emissions, so that to measure the effect users have on the planet. By working with the other devices in a smart home, Tesla's Home's system coordinates appliances like your lights, air conditioning and security cameras to ensure those energy savings. Similarly, the facial recognition along with motion detector equipped security system will ensure that you breathe safe and at the same time help in saving energy.
